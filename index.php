					<p>He studied at a private school before heading to the University of Connecticut's School of Business. 
						There he studied Finance and studied abroad in Grenoble, France. He chose Finance because of his enjoyment
						problem solving and working with numbers. In France, he studied with a very diverse international crowd, 
						and he improved his French-speaking skills. He fell in love with the culture and its people, eventually
						leading him back as a professional in future years. He also studied at the Sorbonne University in business
						in Paris. The highlight of his studies there was doing a week-long seminar in Prague, Czech Republic. In
						Boston, he recently committed to a path of technology and startups by doing the Startup Institute's Spring
						2013 program and focusing now 100% on learning front and back-end development.</p>
					<aside>
						<p>Currently, he is taking 3 extension school classes, along with a plethora of online ones.</p>

					<p>After school, I moved to New York City and worked as the third member of a small team in charge of managing
						accounts and trades for funds with total assets under management of $6 billion. I worked there for 3 years
						before moving to Paris, France to work at a French hedge fund that used computer algorithm to direct
						trades. I worked in the operations there and spoke both French and English during meetings and throughout
						the day. I also drank a ton of espresso. I left after a year because I wasn't happy with what I did. I 
						took some MBA classes at the Sorbonne, staying in Paris for an extra year. I returned in 2010 to start
						my own food business (Italian gelato) with my younger sister in our home town. I did that for a year, then
						moved to Boston to work in the financial operations of a clean tech company. I finally made the move
						to focus on the career path of my passion this past Spring: technology and coding!</p>

						<p>Each job experience had its merits. I am happy to have had the experiences that I have had.</p>
